# csci135-project-2
A crossword solving program. 

The only file I was allowed to alter was solve.cpp. Managed to secure 1st place in the class leaderboard for the first two rounds. The project was intended to run on linux. 

Only needs to be compiled via the make command, and ran with "./solve XXX.cross" with XXX being substituted with the numbers/names of any of the .cross files included in the code or examples folder.
